This could help me to adjust the \"laziness\" of the partial renderer to give me the latency/throughput trade-off that is right for my app.\r\n\r\nWould you accept a patch to do this?

    "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nWhen I was working with [this workshop](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-performance), especially with [this exercise part](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-performance/blob/main/src/final/06.extra-3.js#L108-L117) (the goal there is to create a convenient, reusable HOC), I found out that wrapping a component in `React.forwardRef` and then in `React.memo` distorts profiling report (when using `Profiler` tab of React Developer Tools).\r\n\r\nFor demonstration purposes I removed unrelated stuff and now the application looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97773045-b6571180-1b5d-11eb-9025-8f1dcd26f821.png)\r\nWhen you click on a cell, the number inside changes to another one.\r\n\r\nReact version: 17.0.0\r\nReact Developer Tools: 4.9.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n1. Start profiling the app (using `Profiler` tab of React Developer Tools).\r\n2. Click on a cell.\r\n3. Stop profiling the app and check re-rendered components.\r\n4. Wrap `Wrapper` component in `forwardRef` (see the code in the repo below) and repeat steps 1-3.\r\n\r\nLink to code example: https://codesandbox.io/s/usage-of-reacforwardref-in-reactmemo-81cuh?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nWithout `forwardRef`: according to the profiling report, all the cells re-render.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97772842-c4a42e00-1b5b-11eb-9b49-8d2bd6f122aa.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97772848-d4bc0d80-1b5b-11eb-8f41-9378bc7418ba.png)\r\n\r\nWith `forwardRef`: according to the profiling report, only the changed cell re-renders.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97772866-fcab7100-1b5b-11eb-9de9-c4aa34b48299.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10310491/97772876-07fe9c80-1b5c-11eb-8038-aa9a0ffce473.png)\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThere should be no difference in the reports. I added some `console.log`-s and they demonstrate that adding `forwardRef` doesn't improve performance/reduce re-renders, which seems correct.\r\n\r\nCC @kentcdodds",

    "body": "DevTools closes the bridge whenever it is unmounted [(Link to relevant code)](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-devtools-shared/src/devtools/views/DevTools.js#L172-L181). In the case of the chrome extension this is fine because the node is never unmounted, but in use cases with `react-devtools-inline` (eg: codesandbox), where you are only given one <DevTools/> instance this causes the bridge to be closed, and never recreated if for whatever reason <DevTools/> is unmounted (which happens when switching tabs).\r\n\r\nI am willing to submit a PR, but wanted to discuss the fix before making it - the fix I see is adding a flag to <DevTools/> to not close the bridge on unmount, and making it an opt-in flag users of <DevTools/> (recommended in the case of react-devtools-inline). Adding an ability to manually access the bridge would then let the developer manually control the lifecycle - but I'm unsure the risk/issue of keeping a dangling bridge open, so I don't see this as strictly necessary.\r\n\r\nReact version: N/A\r\nReact-devtools-inline: 4.9.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.  Create a code-sandbox React environment\r\n2. Open React DevTools tab\r\n3. Switch to Problems tab (or any other tab)\r\n4. Switch back to React DevTools tab\r\n5. Bridge has been closed, `index.js:55 Cannot send message \"highlightNativeElement\" through a Bridge that has been shutdown.` is printed in console. New react nodes can not be inspected.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example: N/A\r\nCode example isn't relevant, any CodeSandbox will reproduce this. (even with no additional code)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nInspecting elements that haven't previously been inspected will fail because bridge communication fails if the <DevTools/> ever unmounts and remounts\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThe bridge doesn't close even on unmount when using `react-devtools-inline`, or an option is available when mounting <DevTools/> to not automatically close the bridge.",

    "body": "<!--\r\n  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include\r\n  screenshots if needed. Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: experimental\r\n\r\nI found this bug while trying out `useOpaqueIdentifier` on a component that uses `aria-activedescendant`. It works great on a CRA app, but it breaks on server rendered apps.\r\n\r\nThe way it's implemented is that each item registers its id into a state up in the tree so the container element can get the active id and render it on the `aria-activedescendant` prop.\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple server rendered app (for example, using Next.js).\r\n2. Create a component that uses `React.unstable_useOpaqueIdentifier` and passes the generated object to a component up in the tree through callbacks.\r\n3. Try to render the generated ID to a prop in the ancestor component. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-useopaqueidentifier-aria-activedescendant-bug-geutb?file=/pages/index.js:0-412\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nIt throws an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnhandled Runtime Error\r\nError: The object passed back from useOpaqueIdentifier is meant to be passed through to attributes only.

The main problem is connected to Electron (afaik since version 5) not being able to launch without binary being owned by root and chmod 4755. The issue is with the new sandbox and the priviledges it requires to launch. \r\n\r\nThere is also another workaround I found some months ago on the dedicated thread from Electron's GH (since this is a common issue for Linux users of all Electron applications) that works for every packaged Electron app and binary.\r\nInstead of modifying the electron binary permissions, you can instead tweak an option of your running kernel by doing: \r\n```\r\nsudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThen your Electron apps will launch, and thus so will React DevTools.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this if it isn't relevant here (since not really an issue with devtools itself, rather with Electron x Debian), but I haven't found anything regarding this matter and I think someone might encounter this issue in the future (hoping I'm not totaly mistaken about this to begin with :smile:)",

    "body": "As mentioned in the [blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html), the current automatic JSX runtime transform transpiles the following code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<div height={10} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo roughly:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {jsx as _jsx} from 'react/jsx-runtime'\r\n\r\n_jsx('div', {height: 10})\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the bundling story for this kind of import from a CJS module like `'react/jsx-runtime'` isn't great, because Webpack needs to be conservative about inter-op. Webpack 4 ends up bundling it as something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nObject(R.jsx)('div', {height: 10})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWebpack 5 does slightly better:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n(0, R.jsx)('div', {height: 10})\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut these are both pretty unfortunate. The `jsx` family of functions never uses `this` so the context escape is unnecessary, but Webpack doesn't know that. This was [raised on Twitter here](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1306567501799661570).\r\n\r\nHowever, this can actually be fixed by having the JSX transform create a namespace import instead of a named one. In other words, if it instead transpiled the above code to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as _JSXRuntime from 'react/jsx-runtime'\r\n\r\n_JSXRuntime.jsx('div', {height: 10})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWebpack 4 and 5 will both bundle that code to something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nR.jsx('div', {height: 10})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is the desired output. It's smaller and more efficient than either of the alternatives.\r\n\r\n(The only improvement from there would be to call `jsx` directly, but that isn't possible until the runtime is available as an ESM module and Webpack can inline and concatenate it. I won't get into that here, although it would be really nice. 🙂)\r\n\r\nI know that this change would get made in the Babel repo rather than here, but I wanted to run it by the React team first. @gaearon and @lunaruan, do you see any reason not to make this change?",

    "body": "Is it bad to use setState for getting current state in async event handlers?\r\n\r\n![25C4002A-8A34-49CA-A3EE-898419EF98DF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31843788/97357104-eecac700-18a1-11eb-9af9-ddcd04d9c2be.jpeg)\r\n\r\n It works good but feels wrong, so you might say why it is wrong. I know recommended approach is to use refs, but why have redundant work with sync ref and state. If it is safe to access current state due function updater for setState so you can omit unnecessary state deps for callback, why it might be not safe to get current state in async handler?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nYou have “follow” user button. When you click it update local state optimistically and make server request. While server request pending you might click again and change local state, but prevent making new requests. When request is resolved you need to compare latest local state and expected server state and repeat request if they aren’t equal.\r\n",

    "body": "Currently `react` and `react-is` are built using a `shared/` package. That means that `react-is` (just like `react-dom`) has to have the same version number as `react` to avoid potential issues due to different code from `shared/`.\r\n\r\nHowever, right now a lot of [libraries are wrongly declaring `react-is` as a direct dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/react-is)<sup>1</sup> while declaring  `react` as a peer. Technically correct would be declaring `react-is` as a peer as well leading to more burden for app developers. This is slightly different to having `react` as a peer dependency because every app developer also needs `react` as a dependency. The same doesn't always hold true for `react-is`.\r\n\r\nSince `react-is` has no dependencies it would be more ergonomically for libraries if `react-is` would be available from `react/is` since they already have `react` as a peer dependency. There are two possibilities for this:\r\n1. Move `react-is` to `react/is`\r\n1. Make `react-is` a dependency of `react` and re-export it from `react/is`\r\n\r\nI guess marking `react-is` as a peer would be the approach that would be more consistent. It's really just annoying for libraries but if that's what you would recommend then I'm fine with it as well.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell this is really just a technicality right now i.e. I haven't seen any actual issues. I just stumbled over it while working on React 17 compat. So far it looks like we're in a position to declare 16.8 and 17 as the range for react in our `peerDependencies` which leaves us with a slightly awkward `\"react-is\": \"^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0\"` in the `dependencies` (I might be trying too hard to avoid additional peer deps).\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Popular examples include `prop-types`, `react-redux`, `react-router`, `@material-ui/core`,  `next`\r\n",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: ^16.13.1\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Mount an input component\r\n2. Type anything\r\n3. Unmount input component\r\n\r\nSmall code sample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst InputWrapper = () => {\r\n  const Siblings = React.useMemo(() => new Array(1000).fill(1).map((_,i) => <div key={i}/>), []);\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input />\r\n      {Siblings}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport const Demo = () => {\r\n  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false);\r\n\r\n  const handleShow = React.useCallback(() => {\r\n    setShow((prev) => !prev);\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  const closeRef = React.useRef<number>(0);\r\n  \r\n  const handleShowMany = React.useCallback(() => {\r\n    closeRef.current = 0;\r\n    const id = setInterval(() => {\r\n      setShow(prev => !prev);\r\n      if (closeRef.current++ > 10000) {\r\n        clearInterval(id);\r\n      }\r\n    }, 1);\r\n  }, [setShow])\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <button onClick={handleShow}>{show ? \"hide\" : \"show\"}</button>\r\n      <button onClick={handleShowMany}>{closeRef.current}</button>\r\n      {show && <InputWrapper />}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nCurrently when mounting the input controller for the first time, a small increase in fiber nodes occurs, and after typing in the input box, seemingly the entire React fiber tree is leaked. When mounting/unmounting the input again, there is no clean up (even after thousands of iterations).\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThe fiber nodes to be cleaned up after unmounting the input element.\r\n\r\nComparison memory+fiber nodes on Chrome 69 vs Chrome 86:\r\n\r\n**Chrome 69**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54151393/97064044-3e368d80-1558-11eb-8676-3ee913542cc5.png)\r\n\r\n**Chrome 86**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54151393/97064051-4db5d680-1558-11eb-834b-04a26f4c507a.png)\r\n\r\n**Note the 600kb increase in memory per scenario in Chrome 86, vs the <100KB in Chrome 69, as well as the difference in Fiber nodes**\r\n\r\n**The final number of fiber nodes in the Chome 69 snapshot is the same as the initial count of fiber nodes in Chrome 86 after mounting the input element for the first time:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54151393/97064148-ca48b500-1558-11eb-9b41-ca397b1156a7.png)\r\n",

    "body": "This is a weird one. Basically, if you add an event listener to the document in an effect that was triggered by an event. e.g. `click` toggles some state, which triggers an effect, which adds a `click` handler to the document. In the normal case the new event handler will \"miss\" the triggering event, e.g. the added click handler won't respond to the click event that triggered it being added (omg). \r\n\r\nHOWEVER, if you render a portal first, the timing changes slightly and the added event handler will see the current event.\r\n\r\nReact version: 17\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-playground-forked-cyt0f?file=/index.js\r\n\r\n1. Click the \"show Message\" button to see a message toggle in and out\r\n2. Click the \"Render Portal\" button (see a portal rendered into the body)\r\n3. Click the \"show Message\" button again and notice nothing happens\r\n\r\nThe reason for the final behavior is the click event both opens and closes the message, (calls set state twice)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-playground-forked-cyt0f?file=/index.js\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThat they be consistent",

    "body": "Today, `useLayoutEffect` can be used for synchronous read/writes across the DOM.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n  // Write\r\n  ref.current.style.transform = \"\"\r\n\r\n  // Read\r\n  const box = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a single instance of a single component, this works well. But if this code is repeated or reused anywhere in the tree, we trigger  [layout thrashing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing). The severity of the layout thrashing scales linearly with the number of hooks/components featuring either this code or code like it.\r\n\r\nHooks and components are designed to be composable, yet it's this trivial to write one that isn't. \r\n\r\nInstead, what I'd like is a batched version of `useLayoutEffect` that provides `read` and `write` callbacks. These schedule callbacks that will be called:\r\n\r\n1. Synchronously before paint\r\n2. In \"parallel\" in reads/writes/reads etc\r\n3. After all child components in the tree have run `useLayoutEffect` - including those entering the tree (currently these don't mount until after other `useLayoutEffect`s have been called)\r\n\r\nIt could look like this, though I'm more interested in the above specs than actual API:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseBatchedLayoutEffect((read, write) => {\r\n  write(() =>  {\r\n    ref.current.style.transform = \"\"\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  read(() => {\r\n    const box = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, adhering the 3 specifications above, these callbacks are executed in order, so all `read`s from across the tree, then all `write`s, then all `read`s etc. There is no upper limit for the number of permitted ping-ponged reads/writes IMO as the amount of layout thrashing you could possibly suffer will never be worse than the single hungriest hook. In my experience I've never needed more than a read/write/read/write.\r\n\r\n## Measurement accuracy\r\n\r\nIn the given example, we're measuring a component after first resetting its `transform` because we want to snapshot its actual bounding box without any transforms applied. But if this component is [nested in itself](https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-varahamihira-2qiyw?file=/src/App.js), so both a parent and child are performing the same type of animation, we want to unset all the transforms before measuring any of the elements, otherwise the resulting measurements will be incorrect.\r\n\r\n## What about `requestAnimationFrame`?\r\n\r\nTheoretically it could be possible to implement this ourselves in userland by creating a batcher that executes on the next available frame. Sadly this isn't possible in practise. For whatever browser-internal reason it is necessary to run these reads and writes synchronously to prevent flashes of incorrectly-styled components.\r\n\r\nIf you play with this very simple layout animation implementation by clicking on the red box you'll see it suffers no flashes:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/broken-star-cycfz?file=/src/App.js:528-537\r\n\r\nBut if you uncomment the wrapping `requestAnimationFrame` within the `useLayoutEffect` you'll see it does randomly flash with the undesired styles.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nI have a few custom hooks in my projects that I'd like to access using the namespaced module pattern like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as customModule from './customModule'\r\n\r\n//...\r\n          customModule.useCustomEffect(() => {\r\n            console.log(props.foo);\r\n          }, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, even if I add `additionalHooks: 'useCustomEffect'` as an option to the exhaustive-deps rule, it still wouldn't check my hooks when called this way in the previous implementation.\r\n\r\nI looked into the code for the rule and was able to update the rule to support this pattern properly, and modified one of the existing test cases to prevent it from regressing in the future.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nI have updated the test suite with the following new test case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                  customModule.useCustomEffect(() => {\r\n                    console.log(props.foo);\r\n                  }, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd verified that the expected errors are thrown.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm unsure about though, is related to the fact that we previously had a test case for the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                  React.useCustomEffect(() => {\r\n                    console.log(props.foo);\r\n                  }, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd expected to have no errors, which ended up failing after my change, as it'd now error due to the missing props.foo dependency. \r\n\r\nI ended up removing this test case because the premise didn't make any sense to me: Why shouldn't we check calls to `useCustomEffect` just because it has `React` as the namespace? The user could very well have a custom module that aliases the react module (`export * from 'react'`) and then exposes other custom hooks along with it. I could definitely be missing some nuance here, so please let me know if the test case is actually valid and I'll try to address it in a follow up.",

    "body": "I've been asked about the safety of a certain pattern and I'd like to clarify this with you (the React team). \r\n\r\nIn my opinion - the actual SSRed output and the hydrating tree **do not have to match**. This is, of course, a weird space of things and one should understand how things work together to even think about it, but there is no technical aspect forbidding this now. Question is - is it safe to assume that such a \"use case\" will stay supported in the future. I believe it is because the only thing that is used as an input to the rehydration is the current HTML structure and the React team doesn't intend to ship any extra metadata in the SSRed output about the actual render tree that was used to render it.\r\n\r\nThis can be a little bit of a vague question - so let's take a look at an example. Emotion does 2 things on the server differently than on the client:\r\n1. it does not use `React.forwardRef` (refs are useless on the server, so we don't see a need to grow the render tree rather significantly by using it)\r\n2. we render `<style>` elements \"inline\", together with other elements. This is an example SSRed output:\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"react-root\">\r\n  <style data-emotion-css=\"bjcoli\">\r\n    .css-bjcoli{color:green;}\r\n  </style>\r\n  <div class=\"css-bjcoli\">\r\n    <style data-emotion-css=\"ihiui2\">\r\n      .css-ihiui2{color:hotpink;}\r\n    </style>\r\n    <div class=\"css-ihiui2\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"css-ihiui2\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the client we:\r\n- use `React.forwardRef` as it's important to do so\r\n- we **move** `<style>` elements to the `<head>` **before** rehydration can even be called\r\n\r\nThis makes the HTML structure **identical** to what React sees during the first render so there is **no SSR mismatch**, even though initially there kinda is one.\r\n\r\nWe totally understand this is a gray area and trickery - question is: do u plan to make things like this break in the future? I totally would understand the answer being \"we can't guarantee that\", but at the same time it would be great if it would be accompanied by \"probably not, this is _safe_ to do and there are no plans to make this break now\"\r\n\r\ncc @eps1lon ",

It's doable, but it also seems like a good time to raise the question: Is the tracing API worth pursuing as stable? (I don't think so.)",

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nIn trying to align the Roblox Lua version of React (Roact), we came across some circular dependencies between the scheduler, reconciler, and the react packages. Upon deeper inspection, we saw that there are specific workarounds in the rollup scripts and elsewhere to accommodate the circular dependency. After a brief Twitter conversation with @gaearon , we decided to take a crack at untangling them, simplifying the design and eliminating the workarounds from the rollup files. The change looks large, but it is mostly tweaking import paths after moving files. The PR #19971 shows how the untangling can work, end-to-end, passing all tests/flow, and not introducing any new code/design smells.\r\n\r\nOne of the major reasons for the circular dependencies between scheduler, reconciler, and react pacakges, is the responsibilities that are the backing implementation for the ``ReactSharedInternals`` (aka ``__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED``) symbol aren't cohered in a place in the dependency (import) chain that's consistent with the places it currently needs to be imported from. This PR is the first step of taking the bare minimum changes, a very thin slice of the end-to-end transformation is represented in #19971 .\r\n\r\nBased on feedback to #19971 , this PR extracts only the **non-implementation** files (**types**/**stubs**) first, as requested by @gaearon . As such, this PR by itself doesn't break the circular dependencies. If this PR is merged, I'll rebase #19971 and create a new, thin PR that moves the next set of **non-implementation** files (**const**/**stubs** only).\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nOn a MacBook Pro with node 14.12.0, Ran all test, flow, lint, and prettier targets. This included tests with the production and variant environments.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\nReact is not preventing infinite rendering/looping and results in freezing of browser. \r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is because the dependency array of `useEffect` compares object/array by reference. But, this is a serious issue because \r\n- This is a common trap people might get into because of dynamic nature of Javascript, and people might not know the thing they are passing to dependency array is a primitive value or an array/object.\r\n- React should catch this infinite rendering and throw a helpful error. This error is already thrown by React for some of the cases. But, clearly React does not catch this for all the cases.\r\n- The documentation of  `useEffect` does not have a single reference to this gotcha - guarding against passing object/array to the dependency array, since reference of the object/array is being checked, not a deep comparison value. Some solutions already exist like https://github.com/kentcdodds/use-deep-compare-effect, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54095994/react-useeffect-comparing-objects/63965274#63965274. But, only people who are aware of this behaviour of `useEffect` will reach out to these solutions (or they might manually deep compare with their own custom hook as some people do in the linked stackoverflow link)\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful if `useEffect` includes a helpful option like \r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n // myArray, myObject gets new reference on evey render\r\n}, [myArray, myObject], {\r\n   deepCompare: true/false // it would be helpful to have this instead of reaching for custom hooks/npm packages\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nReact version:\r\n`16.12.x` (any latest version)\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Click the `codesandbox` link - https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-client-uselazyquery-example-forked-kmc1u?file=/src/App.js. \r\n2. Click `Topics` link and then select `Countries` link. \r\n\r\n`Warning`: Please be aware that tab/browser will freeze. It is better to open the console before hand, so that you can see the looping from console logs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\n[CodeSandbox reproduction](https://codesandbox.io/s/apollo-client-uselazyquery-example-forked-kmc1u?file=/src/App.js)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior:\r\n- React does not prevent infinite loop/rendering. Browser tab freezes, and the end user has no idea that the tab has freezed. They have to force quit the tab.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n- React should give a helpful warning that an infinite render/loop is going on.\r\n- React should pinpoint the exact issue - the array/object passed to `useEffect` dependency is triggering infinite rendering\r\n",

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nIn trying to align the Roblox Lua version of React (Roact), we came across some circular dependencies. After a brief Twitter conversation with @gaearon , we decided to take a crack at untangling them. The change looks large, but it is mostly tweaking import paths after moving files.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm not sure 'shared' is the right place for some of these things, I think that being able to see the shape of things  will make it clearer how these things could have reasonable cohesion, encapsulate detail, and not have any cycles.\r\n\r\nIt felt particularly good to delete some workaround in the rollup/build scripts that were only there to trick tools into not getting stuck on the circular dependencies. I'd like to be able to remove the ReactSharedInternals reference in react/React.js and just export is from react/index.js, but it looks like some of the tooling demands that it stay there. There were other little things I left in place like that, to not unnecessarily disrupt things.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nOn a MacBook Pro with node 14.12.0, there are a few tests that fail after a fresh checkout. I want to see if those come up in CI as well, or if it's something in my environment. Besides that caveat, ran all test, flow, lint, and prettier targets. As you'll see in the commits, a few of the circular dependencies were purely in types and had to be worked out.",

Currently, there is no easy way to jump to a specific commit. The navigation options are:\r\n\r\n1. Use the arrow keys to inc/dec by 1\r\n2. Use the left/right buttons to inc/dec by 1\r\n3. Click and drag on the graph to inc/dec by larger amounts. \r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the first number in the `x / y` fraction with an `<input>` element so the user can directly navigate to a specific commit.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change.

    "body": "HTML [`<template>` tag]() is used to pass reusable templates to web components.\r\nHowever, at the moment this doesn't work with React in a way that is useful to users.\r\n\r\n### Context: Basic usage of `<template>`\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have HTML like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n\t<p>Some Text</p>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then use this template with pure JS like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst template = document.querySelector(\"template\")\r\n\r\nconst node = template.content.cloneNode(true)\r\n\r\ndocument.append(node)\r\n```\r\nThe important part here is the `content` property of the template.\r\n\r\n### Whats the problem?\r\n\r\nWriting the template code in HTML is OK. However, if you create the template DOM nodes with JS like this, it won't work:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst template = document.createElement(\"template\")\r\nconst p = document.createElement(\"p\")\r\np.textContent = \"Some Text\"\r\ntemplate.appendChild(p)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the `content` property of the template will be empty. Instead, one would have to do either of these:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst template = document.createElement(\"template\")\r\ntemplate.innerHTML = \"<p>Some Text</p>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst template = document.createElement(\"template\")\r\nconst p = document.createElement(\"p\")\r\np.textContent = \"Some Text\"\r\ntemplate.content.appendChild(p) // notice `content`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first does work because there is a special case in `innerHTML` for template tags (see [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML#Operational_details)).\r\nThe second example works because the `<p>` DOM node is added directly to the `content` of the template.\r\n\r\n### What does this has to do with React?\r\n\r\nWhen using React to create the template, React is appending the generated DOM nodes directly to the template node and not to the `content` property of the template node. For this reason at the moment you can't really use template tags in React apps.\r\n\r\nI have the impression that this is not the fault of React as the same problem exists for angular and most likely other spa frameworks too. Instead this looks like a misconception of the `template` tag to me (mayby I'm wrong on this and there is a good reason for this behavior). \r\nHowever, maybe React could do something to make this usecase less anoying? A possible solution could be to detect if the parent node is a `template` and to add the child nodes to the `content` property instead of the node itself. But I'm not sure if there would be any negative side-effects of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The `shallowEqual()` function located in `packages/shared/shallowEqual.js` is incorrectly using `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` instead of `Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable()`, which is the correct counterpart for `Object.keys()`. \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n------------\r\nThe `Object.keys()` method used inside `shallowEqual()` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names. But `hasOwnProperty.call(...)` (used in the `for` loop titled `Test for A's keys different from B`), checks only one of those things: ownership. Which causes the bug pointed out below. `Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable()` must be used instead which checks both direct ownership and enumerable-ity.\r\n\r\nReact version: v16.13.1\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst person = {\r\n  name: 'Salman',\r\n  age: 25,\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst personWithProfession = {\r\n  name: 'Salman',\r\n  profession: 'Software Engineer', // This property goes undetected by shallowEqual()\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Add age\r\nObject.defineProperty(personWithProfession, 'age', {\r\n  value: 25, // non-enumerable by default\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst keysA = Object.keys(person);\r\nconst keysB = Object.keys(personWithProfession);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(keysA); // name,age\r\nconsole.log(keysB); // name,profession\r\n\r\nconsole.log(keysA.length === keysB.length); // true // Passes the length check\r\n```\r\n\r\nLink to code example with a demonstration and fixed version:\r\n[https://codesandbox.io/s/infallible-keldysh-r98gl?file=/src/index.js](https://codesandbox.io/s/infallible-keldysh-r98gl?file=/src/index.js)\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n```\r\nshallowEqual(person, personWithProfession) // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n```\r\nshallowEqual(person, personWithProfession) // false\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The fix\r\nReplace\r\n`!hasOwnProperty.call(objB, keysA[i])`\r\nwith:\r\n`!propertyIsEnumerable.call(objB, keysA[i])`",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: 16.13.1\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on a `p` element where the `__html` contains a `<p>` tag\r\n2. Server-side render this component and try to hydrate\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n```html\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    <script crossorigin src=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js\"></script>\r\n    <script crossorigin src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js\"></script>\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <!-- Pretend for an instance that this html was generated on the server by ReactDOM.renderToString() -->\r\n    <div id=\"app\"><p><p>Dope!</p></p></div>\r\n  </body>\r\n  <script>\r\n    function Component() {\r\n      return React.createElement(\"p\", {\r\n        dangerouslySetInnerHTML: { __html: \"<p>Dope!</p>\" },\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n    const component = React.createElement(Component)\r\n    const root = document.getElementById(\"app\")\r\n    ReactDOM.hydrate(component, root)\r\n  </script>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nJSFiddles:\r\n- This one breaks because it has nesting `p`:  https://jsfiddle.net/mw19p0g3/\r\n- This one works because the wrapper is `div` instead of `p`: https://jsfiddle.net/mw19p0g3/2/\r\n- This one works too because there no nesting `p` in the html: https://jsfiddle.net/mw19p0g3/3/\r\n\r\n## The current behaviour\r\nThe `ReactDOM.hydrate` throws a cryptic error:\r\n```\r\nWarning: Prop `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` did not match. Server: \"\" Client: \"<p>Dope!</p>\"\r\n```\r\nNote the missing `Server: \"\"` string.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nDo not throw an error and just hydrate the component as expected.\r\n\r\nI realise that nesting `p` elements does not conform to the [HTML spec for the p element](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#h-9.3.1).\r\nIf React chooses not to support the use case of nesting `p` tags through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, that's understandable. \r\nIn that case the error should be more descriptive and there should probably also be an error or warning while performing the server side render. \r\nIt should also be documenting somewhere that will easily show up in Google.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour is very confusing and it took me a while to track down what was going on.\r\n",

I'm not sure if there are better approaches though; feedback welcome!\r\n\r\n![main](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12784593/94020160-2fd44500-fde5-11ea-85f2-a08e6f09ffa4.gif)\r\n\r\nThe main goal of integrating is to allow us to add a record button to record a performance profile in a future PR. I've figured out a way to do it, and I've made a POC here: https://github.com/taneliang/react-scheduling-profiler-devtools-integration-poc.\r\n\r\nThe scheduling profiler is hidden behind a new `enableIntegratedSchedulingProfiler` DevTools feature flag. Apart from a bundle size increase (`main.js` grows from 1.22 MiB to 1.77 MiB), this PR shouldn't affect any functionality in the existing DevTools if the feature flag is off.\r\n\r\nThis PR is nearly complete, but I'm not sure if adding a tab is what you have in mind @bvaughn. I'm also aware that React 17 will be released soon, and I'm not sure if you'll want to wait until after that release. If this approach looks good and we want to proceed, I'll finish the remaining tasks :)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- Scheduling profiler dark mode isn't disabled in the shell and core packages, even if the dark mode flag is set to false. This is happening because those packages don't mount the scheduling profiler in a different document. As the scheduling profiler has some usability issues in dark mode (from the minor (always-white canvas background), to the major (invisible white tooltip text on a white background)), this likely blocks the scheduling profiler from being released as an integrated part of DevTools. Although we can fix this now by switching the DevTools to light mode when the user opens the scheduling profiler tab, I think it'll be better to just fix the dark mode colors. I/we can do this in future PRs.\r\n- `main.js` bundle size increases from 1.22 MiB to 1.77 MiB. We can trim this to 1.67 MiB if we remove the `profilerBrowser.png` asset.\r\n- The image causes the scheduling profiler to scroll in the shell package.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Ensure Edge extension works (it probably works but I haven't tested it).\r\n- [ ] Fix context menu dismissal behavior.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n\r\n- Implement profile record button\r\n- Replace scheduling profiler tab icon (it's currently the same one as the Profiler tab)\r\n- Add Settings modal to non-standalone deployment of scheduling profiler\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\n\r\n- Tested Chrome and Firefox extensions.\r\n- Tested Electron app\r\n- Tested shell\r\n\t![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12784593/94021628-cce3ad80-fde6-11ea-9a9c-473522952f66.png)\r\n- Flipped `enableIntegratedSchedulingProfiler` to false and ensured scheduling profiler tab/panel does not appear.",

    "body": "Let's suppose that I'm trying to define a custom hook using useEffect (the same comment applies for other hooks relying on dependencies such as useCallback, useMemo, useLayoutEffect, etc...):\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {useEffect} from \"react\"\r\n\r\nexport const useWindowScroll = (dependencies) => {\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0,0)\r\n  }, dependencies)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be the ideal code to write to make this hook re-usable:\r\n- It encapsulates the exact business logic, which is to scroll back to the top of the page when one of the dependencies change\r\n- It works using similar syntax to a standard React hook, so provides a nice interface to the developer\r\n- It's as simple as it gets: do the exact thing you've always been doing with the standard hooks. \r\n\r\nHowever, this leads to problems because React complains about the 'dependencies' array. There are different ways one could go about solving this, but they all feel sort of hacky and unnatural to me, one of them being replacing 'dependencies' by 'JSON.stringify(dependencies)' (suggested by Dan Abramov according to a quote I cannot find anymore). It works, but it looks strange to remember that this trick needs to be done.\r\n\r\nSomething else that would also be practical would be to be able to write [someOtherVariable, ...dependencies] in that second argument of a useEffect/useCallback/use(...), without having to wrap it in a JSON.stringify.\r\n\r\nIs there anything that we could do in React itself to make the API for custom hooks simpler when it comes to dependencies?

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\n#18051\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the [discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/61), ESLint does not implement React-specific logic, and therefore JSX Identifiers will not be treated by ESLint as regular variables with references to them in scopes.\r\n\r\nBecause of this circumstance, when we collect hook callback dependencies, JSX variables don't end up in the list of dependencies and JSX-component variables declared in the hook dependencies array are considered exhaustive, but they are not.\r\n\r\nSo I implemented a prototype of a possible solution to this problem — handling JSX-expressions in the dependency gathering logic of the plugin.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, if JSX is found in the callback hook, then I traverse the JSX tree of elements and collect a list of React components. In the process, I filter out all elements that are not React components. Then I add the resulting array to the list of collected dependencies, which will be checked for exhaustiveness or lack of dependencies.\r\n\r\nMy prototype solution is imperfect at the moment, it doesn't find JSX-expressions in if/else constructions, it does not fully support JSXMemberExpressions, I have not yet written Typescript tests, etc. But I will do my best if I know that this is the right way.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n✅ All test, test-prod, lint, flow checks are passed.\r\nAdded some new tests for positive and negative cases of JSX support.",

It's debateable whether React should recommend `readOnly` when this isn't a standard attribute like `readOnly` for `<input type=\"text\" />`.\r\n",

See repro steps below and code comments for additional details.\r\n\r\n### React version: 16.13.1\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open https://codepen.io/jesseko/pen/dyMqGKG\r\n2. Observe that logging shows a single entry, the `change` event being emitted from a child component after render.  We expect a second log from a parent's `onChange` but it never comes.\r\n3. Change `EVENT_TYPE` to `'input'`\r\n4. Observe that logging shows two entries, one for the event being emitted and a second for it being detected via an `onInput` handler in the parent component.\r\n5. optional: there's some commented out code at the bottom to test a vanilla JS listener.  Change `EVENT_TYPE` back to `'change'` and uncomment that code and you'll see that that listener does work\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "React 17 uses native browser frames for stack traces, which means that host elements like `<div>` no longer have line numbers. And for components, you get the definition frame rather than the JSX callsite frame. For the most part this is fine — especially if the browsers start using sourcemaps for when stack frames URLs are printed via `console.error`. However, there is one particular case that I feel has regressed in usability.\r\n\r\nKey warnings really _are_ scoped to the particular JSX callsite. Often you may have several `map()` or such in one component, and figuring out which key is missing is annoying. Unlike other warnings where the fault may lie with props passed to the wrapper \"design system\" components, with missing keys in my experience the fix tends to be exactly where the JSX callsite is.\r\n\r\nWe already use source location in a custom way for the \"invalid type\" warning. In this PR, I'm reusing it (if available) to append an addendum with the line number and the filename to the message. This doesn't mess with the stack format but provides the exact pointer to what you need to fix for this particular warning. All other warnings are left as they are.\r\n\r\n### React 16\r\n\r\n<img width=\"598\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-09-11 at 15 29 09\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/92941691-9d2cc100-f448-11ea-9c52-c6bc4e234a34.png\">\r\n\r\n### React 17 (before this PR)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"651\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-09-11 at 15 02 51\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/92946179-31e5ed80-f44e-11ea-9c47-b72afc56c4c7.png\">\r\n\r\n### React 17 (after this PR)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"673\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-09-11 at 15 28 06\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/92941770-b33a8180-f448-11ea-8d22-24b67656aaee.png\">\r\n\r\nI verified the change in a real app with both new and old JSX transforms.",

Focus your cursor at the end of the third input text\r\n3. Press CMD + Backspace\r\n\r\nThis successfully removes the third todo, but also sets the `text` attribute of the forth to an empty string, because the onChange event callback is called on the same input, but a new model is attached to it. Since CMD + Backspace has deleted the content of the input, the value of `e.target` in the `onChange` callback is an empty string, thus setting the value of the newly attached model to `''`.\r\n\r\nNote that if the input is not being focused on in the `componentDidUpdate` method, the onChange event does not occur. The onChange event also does not occur if we wrap the focusing of the input in a `setTimeout(..., 0)`.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe input probably shouldn't be reused for a different model. The parent of the input is `<div key={todo.id}>`, so the input element should probably be recreated.",
